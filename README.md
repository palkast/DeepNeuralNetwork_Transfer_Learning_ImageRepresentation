DeepNeuralNetwork_Transfer_Learning_ImageRepresentation

2023 Fall Semester gave me an opportunity to leverage my understanding of Deep Neaural Network and several cutting edge models through transfer learning on a set of images in order to measure the cuteness of the pets.
Implemented Deep Neural Network Transfer Learning for Image Representation, advancing image analysis and recognition capabilities.
This is a project completed by me and my team during MSBA Fall Semester.

This includes the following :
1.Code 
2.Technical write up
3.Technical presentation

Explored several methods :
1.With Metadata

2.Without metadata
